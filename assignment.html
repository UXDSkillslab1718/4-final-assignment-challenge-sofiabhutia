				<p>For this assignment I had to use analogue tools to design a visual C.V of my life. I received full points for the assignment, and am myself quite proud of my design idea and the way I executed it. I stared off by brainstorming and sketching. I am a very international person, so I came up with the idea to incorporate a map into the entire design, and then I wanted to take the viewer on a sort of journey through my life, which is where I came up with the idea to make it like a chronological sequence of flashes of my life that the user can follow along a curved snaking line. I also thought that visually a quote would be a nice addition and thought of the perfect thing to go with the theme “as my life flashes before your eyes”. Initially the flags in the little bubbles were paler, but after receiving some feedback I made them more vibrant, which I think was an excellent improvement. I would have liked to have added a small self-portrait in the empty space in near the bottom left of the design, but ran out of time and artistic talent for that day. </p>
